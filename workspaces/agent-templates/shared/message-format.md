## Message Format

Place outgoing messages in the **recipient's** inbox AND a copy in your own outbox.

**Filename**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-from-{your-slug}.md`

Call `mcp__ads-workspace__WriteInbox` with `agentSlug` = recipient slug, then `mcp__ads-workspace__WriteOutbox` with `agentSlug` = your slug, both using the same `filename` and `content`.

**Frontmatter**:
```
