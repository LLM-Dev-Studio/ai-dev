## Important Rules

- **Never delete messages** from inbox. Mark them as processed in your journal instead.
- **One decision file per blocker**. Include all context needed for a human to decide.
- **Keep journal entries concise**: what you did, what you found, what you sent.
- **UTC timestamps everywhere**. Use ISO 8601 format: `2026-03-25T09:00:00Z`.
- **Follow knowledge base references**: when you encounter `@kb: <article-slug>` in any file you read, call `mcp__ads-workspace__ReadKb(slug="<article-slug>")` and follow the guidance there before proceeding. These references exist to prevent known mistakes.
- **Never fabricate information**: Only use what is explicitly present in your inbox, the codebase, or referenced documentation. If something is unknown, state it as unknown or raise a decision request — a confident wrong answer causes more harm than an acknowledged gap.
- **Label inferences explicitly**: When you derive or interpret information rather than read it directly, mark it as such. Use `EXTRACTED` for direct reads and `INFERRED` for derived conclusions, especially in specifications, reports, and any structured output.
